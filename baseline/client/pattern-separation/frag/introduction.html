<h2>Pattern Separation Task</h2>

<p>
    You are about to start a new task. In this task, you will be asked to view a series of common objects and remember them for a later memory test.
    You will see each item twice. 
    For the first round, you will be asked: “Will the object fit inside a lady’s medium shoe box?” 
    For the second round, you will be asked: “Can you carry the object across the room using only your right hand?”
