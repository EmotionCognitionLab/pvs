<h2>Pattern Separation Task</h2>

<p>
    You are about to start a new task. In this task, you will first view pictures of common objects. 
    You will see each object twice. For the first round you will be asked, "Will the object fit inside a lady's medium shoe box?" 
    For the second round you will be asked, "Can you carry the object across the room using only your right hand?" 
    After answering these questions for all objects you will be given a memory test later.
