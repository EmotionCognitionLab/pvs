You will see 30 objects twice. For the first round you will be asked, "Will the object fit inside a lady's medium shoe box?" For the second round you will be asked, "Can you carry the object across the room using only your right hand?" Please answer the question presented underneath the object by pressing "y" for "yes" or "n" for "no" and try to remember them for a later memory test. Please note that the memory test will be given about 20 minutes after seeing all images.
