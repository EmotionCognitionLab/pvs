<h2>Pattern Separation Task</h2>
<p>
    Now you will be tested on your memory.
    During the memory test, you will be shown both new and old objects.
    For an object to be considered “old”, all the objects’ features must be exactly the same.
    This includes the objects’ color, size, and orientation.
    If the object’s features do not exactly match the features of the previously shown object, it is considered “new”.
    Please indicate whether each item is 1 = definitely old, 2 = maybe old, 3 = maybe new, or 4 = definitely new.
    “Definitely old” means you are confident that the object is old.
    “Maybe old” means that you think the object is old, but not completely sure.
    “Maybe new” means that you think the object is new, but not completely sure.
    “Definitely new” means you are confident that the object is new.
