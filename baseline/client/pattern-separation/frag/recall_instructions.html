During the memory test, you will be shown both new and old objects. "New" means that you have not seen the object in the earlier part of this study today. 
"Old" means that you have seen the object in the earlier part of this study today. 
For an object to be considered "old", all the object's features must be exactly the same as the one you saw earlier. 
This includes the object's color, size, and orientation. If the object's features do not exactly match the features of the previously shown object, it is considered "new". 
Please indicate whether each item is 1 = definitely old, 2 = maybe old, 3 = maybe new, or 4 = definitely new by pressing a number key.
<br>
"1 = definitely old" means you are confident that the object is old. <br>
"2 = maybe old" means that you think the object is old, but are not completely sure.<br>
"3 = maybe new" means that you think the object is new, but are not completely sure.<br>
"4 = definitely new" means you are confident that the object is new.
