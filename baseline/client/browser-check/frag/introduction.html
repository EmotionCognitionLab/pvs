<h2>Welcome to the HeartBeam study!</h2>
<p>
    At both the start (now) and the end (around 11 weeks from now) of the study you will be asked to do a series of experiments
    over the course of several days. It's very important that you use the same computer, web browser,
    keyboard and monitor for these experiments.

<p>
    Is this the computer, web browser, keyboard and monitor you want to use to do the experiments now <em>AND</em>
    around 11 weeks from now?
