<h1>Instruction:</h1>
Are you ready for the next challenge? <br>
You will be asked to type as many words starting with one particular letter as you can in one
minute. <br>
Proper nouns will not count towards your total (proper nouns identify a single entity and
are usually capitalized&mdash;for example, London, Jupiter, Sarah, and Microsoft). <br>
When you are ready, please press the spacebar and we will show you the letter. <br>
<em>Press the space bar to begin.</em>
