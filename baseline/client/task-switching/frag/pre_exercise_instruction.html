    Well done! You finished the third round. In the new round, we'll alternate 
    between the greater/less, blue/yellow and big/small rules. The picture will tell you the rule. 
    Pay attention to the picture and respond accordingly. 
    Decide as quickly as possible but try to avoid mistakes. We'll start with a few practice trials.
