Thank you for finishing that task. The next task will be Spatial Orientation.
<br> <br>
This is a test of your ability to imagine different perspectives or orientations in space.
In this task, you will see a picture of a scene of objects with a statement below it, together with an "input circle".
You will be asked to imagine that you are standing at one object in the scene and facing another object.
Your task is to draw a line showing the direction to a third object from this perspective.
On each trial, you will be asked to imagine standing at a different first object, facing a different second object, and then to draw a line to a different third object.
<br> <br>
You respond by "drawing" a line on the arrow circle using the computer mouse.
The center of the input circle represents your imagined location (at the first object) and the vertical line represents your imagined perspective (facing the second object).
You need to draw the direction to a third object from this facing direction.
<br> <br>
Look at the sample trial below. In this example you are asked to imagine that you are standing at the <strong>bell</strong> facing the <strong>tree</strong>.
Your task is to draw a line indicating the direction to the <strong>drum</strong>.
In the sample trial this line has been drawn for you.
In the test trials, your task is to draw this line on the arrow circle using the computer mouse.
Can you see that if you were at the <strong>bell</strong> facing the <strong>tree</strong> the <strong>drum</strong> would be in the direction show by the dotted line?
<br> <br>
Now you will begin practicing on the computer.
