In this example you are asked to imagine that you are standing at the <strong>bell</strong> facing the <strong>tree</strong>.
Your task is to draw a line indicating the direction to the <strong>drum</strong>.
In the sample trial this line has been drawn for you.
In the test trials, your task is to draw this line on the arrow circle using the computer mouse.
Can you see that if you were at the <strong>bell</strong> facing the <strong>tree</strong> the <strong>drum</strong> would be in the direction shown by the dotted line?
