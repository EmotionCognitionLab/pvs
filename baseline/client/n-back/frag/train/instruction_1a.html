In another part of this task, your job is to press the SPACE BAR when the number on the screen is the same as the number immediately before the number currently on the screen. <br>
<br>
For example, if you saw "5, 6, 3, 6, 1, 7, 7", you would press the SPACE BAR when the second "7" is on the screen. This is called the "one-back". <br>
<br>
<em>Press the space bar to continue.</em>
