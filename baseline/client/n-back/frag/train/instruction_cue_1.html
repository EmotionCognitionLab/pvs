Great job! Now you will practice a full-length one-back task. You will press the spacebar for the target number. The target number can be any number between 1-9. During the one-back task you will always press the spacebar when the number currently on the screen is the same as the number shown immediately before. <br>
<div class="n-back-cue-title">One-Back</div>
<table class="n-back-cue-table">
    <td>5</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-highlight">7</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-target n-back-cue-highlight">7</td>
</table>
<em>Press the spacebar to continue.</em>
