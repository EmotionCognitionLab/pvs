Great job! Now you will practice a full-length two-back task. You will press the space bar for the target number. The target number can be any number between 1-9.  During the two-back task you will always press the space bar when the number currently on the screen is the same as the number shown two numbers back. <br>
<div class="n-back-cue-title">Two-Back</div>
<table class="n-back-cue-table"><tbody><tr>
    <td class="n-back-cue-highlight">6</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-target n-back-cue-highlight">6</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<em>Press the space bar to continue.</em>
