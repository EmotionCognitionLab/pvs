For the two-back task, you will press the spacebar when the current number on the screen is the same as the number shown two positions back. <br>
<br>
For example, if you saw "6, 3, 6", you would press the spacebar when the second 6 is on the screen. <br>
You will see this image before the two-back starts: <br>
<div class="n-back-cue-title">Two-Back</div>
<table class="n-back-cue-table">
    <td class="n-back-cue-highlight">6</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-target n-back-cue-highlight">6</td>
</table>
You will always press the spacebar for the target number. The target number can be any number between 1-9. <br>
<br>
<em>Press the space bar to continue.</em>
