For the zero-back task, you will press the space bar when the current number on the screen is the number "1". <br>
<br>
For example, if you saw "6, 1, 7", you would press the space bar when the 1 is on the screen. <br>
You will see this image before the zero-back starts: <br>
<div class="n-back-cue-title">Zero-Back</div>
<table class="n-back-cue-table">
    <td>6</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-target n-back-cue-highlight">1</td>
    <td>7</td>
</table>
When you see this image, you will press the number “0” in order to start the zero-back task.
Once the zero-back task has started, you will always press the space bar for the number 1 during the zero-back task. <br>
<br>
<em>Please press the space bar to continue.</em>
