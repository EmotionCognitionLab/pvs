For the one-back task, you will press the SPACE BAR when the current number on the screen is the same as the number shown immediately before the current number. <br>
<br>
For example, if you saw "5, 6, 3, 6, 1, 7, 7", you would press the SPACE BAR when the second "7" is on the screen. <br>
You will see this image before the one-back starts: <br>
<table class="n-back-cue-table">
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-target">7</td>
</table>
<em>Press the space bar to continue.</em>
