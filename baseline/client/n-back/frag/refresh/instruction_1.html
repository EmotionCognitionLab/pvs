For the one-back task, you will press the space bar when the current number on the screen is the same as the number shown immediately before the current number. <br>
<br>
For example, if you saw "5, 7, 7", you would press the space bar when the second 7 is on the screen. <br>
You will see this image before the one-back starts: <br>
<div class="n-back-cue-title">One-Back</div>
<table class="n-back-cue-table">
    <td>5</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-highlight">7</td>
    <td class="n-back-cue-target n-back-cue-highlight">7</td>
</table>
You will always press the space bar for the target number. The target number can be any number between 1-9. <br>
<br>
<em>Press the space bar to continue.</em>
