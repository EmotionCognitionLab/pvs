    You will see a series of photographs of eyes. For each set of eyes, type 1, 2, 3 or 4 to choose which word best 
    describes what the person in the picture is thinking or feeling. You may feel that more than one word is 
    applicable but please choose just one word, the word which you consider to be most suitable. 
    Before making your choice, make sure that you have read all 4 words. 
    You should try to do the task as quickly as possible. 
    If you do not know what a word means, place your mouse over it and you will see its definition.
